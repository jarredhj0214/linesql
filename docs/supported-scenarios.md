# Supported Scenarios

This document records implemented behavior as LineSQL evolves. Every new parser capability should update this file and add or update SQL cases under the related dialect test resources.

## Spark

Spark is the first implemented dialect. It uses Apache Spark's official ANTLR grammar as the parse baseline, while lineage extraction is implemented by LineSQL.

Current Spark SQL case assets:

```text
linesql-dialect-spark/src/test/resources/sql/spark/manifest.json
linesql-dialect-spark/src/test/resources/sql/spark/cases/*.sql
```

The manifest records executable expectations for statement type, input tables, output tables, column lineage, and expected diagnostics.

### Diagnostics

Current Spark diagnostics:

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `SPARK_PARSE_ERROR` | Spark SQL could not be parsed by the current grammar entry point. |
| `COLUMN_LINEAGE_NOT_IMPLEMENTED` | No column lineage was produced for the statement. Table lineage may still be available. |
| `COLUMN_LINEAGE_PARTIAL` | Some column lineage was produced, but at least one projection could not be resolved safely. |

### Production SQL Tolerance

Implemented Spark tolerance scenarios:

| Scenario | Example shape | Case id |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unquoted scheduler placeholders | `${bizdate}`, `{{ region }}` in expressions | `select_with_placeholders` |
| Backquoted non-ASCII identifiers | Chinese table and column identifiers | `quoted_chinese_identifiers` |
| Bad SQL isolation in scripts | one invalid statement does not block later statements | `script_bad_sql_recovery` |

### Known Gaps

The following Spark lineage features are intentionally not complete yet:

| Gap | Current behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `select *` expansion | Not expanded without schema metadata. |
| Complex CTE column propagation | Chained direct CTE projection and CTE column aliases are supported; recursive CTEs and complex CTE joins are not complete yet. |
| Complex subquery column propagation | Single-level aliased direct subquery projection is supported; nested subquery chains and complex subquery joins are not complete yet. |
| Temporary view scope | Temporary view lineage is maintained inside one `parseScript` call only; persistent catalog view expansion is not implemented yet. |
| Unqualified columns in multi-table queries | Not guessed when they cannot be safely mapped to one table. |
| Complex UDTF and lateral view column propagation | Simple generated columns from UDTF input expressions are supported; full UDTF output semantics are not complete yet. |
| PIVOT/UNPIVOT column lineage | Table-level lineage is supported; generated pivot/unpivot columns are not propagated yet. |
| TRANSFORM column lineage | Table-level lineage is supported; script output semantics are not propagated yet. |
| Multi-insert column lineage | Table-level lineage is supported; per-target column lineage is not emitted yet. |
| Complex nested fields and structs | Basic nested field paths are preserved; schema-aware struct expansion is not implemented yet. |
